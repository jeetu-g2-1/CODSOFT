# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game using Python
**I designed and implemented a Rock, Paper, Scissors game 🎮 from scratch using 🐍 Python.
This 📝 project not only honed my coding skills but also taught me the importance of logical thinking and problem-solving.💡**
## Glimpse
Firstly I have prompted the 👨‍💻 user to choose rock, paper, or scissors and generate a random choice(rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
Determine the winner based on the player's choice and computer's choice.Result will be whether the 📈player wins,loses, or it's tie.
We can also ask the user if they want to ▶play( 🌀 Play Again) another round.
